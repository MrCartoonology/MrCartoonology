## 👋 Hi, I'm David Schneider

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
I'm a machine learning engineer and data scientist focused on generative AI —
especially where it intersects with art, storytelling, and interactivity.

🧪 I write technical blog posts at 
[mrcartoonology.github.io](https://mrcartoonology.github.io) a
nd use this space to share open-source projects that support those explorations.
